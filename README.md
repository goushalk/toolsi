# 🛠️ Tools Installer Bash Script

Welcome to the most chaotic yet beautiful thing you've seen today:  
**A Bash tool that lets you install Basic Linux and CTF tools like a damn buffet.**

---

## 📜 What is this?

This is a terminal-based tool selector.  
You get menus. You pick categories. You smash that install button.  
It slaps useful tools into your system without needing to Google "best Wireshark alternative for Linux" at 2am.

Supports:
- **CTF Tools** (based on domains like Forensics, Crypto, Pwn, Web, and more)
- **Offensive/Defensive Security Essentials**

---

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Clone this repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/goushalk/toolsi.git
    cd toolsi
    ```

2. Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x toolsi.sh
    ```

3. Run it like a boss:

    ```bash
    ./toolsi.sh
    ```

4. Choose your weapons (tools) from the menus.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧹 Clean, simple UI (terminal-based, no fancy dependencies)
- 🛡️ Focused on **security**, **CTF practice**, and **Basic Linux**
- 💥 Fast installs supports APT,DNF,YUM - you know, the good ol' way.
- 🔥 CTF mode: Select tools based on your CTF domain (Web, Pwn, Crypto, Forensics, etc.)
- ✨ Future proof: Easy to add more tools/categories (just edit the arrays!)

---

## 🛑 Requirements

- A brain 🧠 (optional but recommended)
- Linux system with `apt,dnf,yum` package manager (Debian/Arch/REHL.)
- Sudo privileges (`sudo` installed and working)
- Internet connection (or else... what are you even installing?)

---

## 📈 Future Plans (Optional flex)

- Add Snap/Flatpak fallback if Package manager fails
- Add auto-detection for OS
- Add batch install mode (install full categories in one click)
- Add "dry run" to simulate what would install
- Add more CTF-focused tools
- Maybe sprinkle in a sexy ASCII banner? 🎨

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This script installs hacking tools.  
**YOU** are responsible for what you do with them.
